#  **Data Structure Lab ‚Äì Lab 3 & 4**

## üìñ **Overview**

In these labs, we will dive deeper into **C++ pointers** and their applications.
Pointers are one of the most important concepts in Data Structures ‚Äî they allow us to manipulate memory directly, create dynamic data structures, and build efficient programs.

This week, we will cover:

* ‚úÖ **Pointers Basics & Review**
* ‚úÖ **Function Pointers**
* ‚úÖ **Dangling Pointers** (how they occur & how to avoid them)
* ‚úÖ **Null Pointers** (best practices)
* ‚úÖ **Dynamic Memory Allocation** (`new`, `delete`, `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`)
* ‚úÖ **Arrays & Array Traversal**
* ‚úÖ **Array of Lists** (conceptual introduction + small exercise)

## üéØ **Learning Objectives**

By the end of these labs, students will be able to:

* Declare, initialize, and use **pointers** effectively.
* Pass and return pointers from functions.
* Use **function pointers** to call functions dynamically.
* Identify and prevent **dangling pointer problems**.
* Work with **null pointers** safely.
* Allocate and deallocate memory dynamically.
* Understand how arrays work internally and how they relate to pointers.
* Implement a **basic array-of-list structure** to store multiple lists in memory.

## üõ† **Lab Instructions**

1. **Clone or Pull Latest Repo**
   Make sure you have the latest version of the lab materials from GitHub before starting:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Open Starter Code**
   Go through the examples provided for:

   * Pointer basics
   * Function pointer example
   * Dangling & null pointer scenarios
   * Dynamic memory allocation with `new` / `delete` and `malloc` / `calloc`

3. **Complete Lab Tasks**

   * Write code to demonstrate pointer usage with variables.
   * Write a small program using **function pointers** (e.g., calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide).
   * Write code to simulate a **dangling pointer** scenario, then fix it.
   * Allocate memory dynamically for an array of integers using `malloc` or `new`.
   * Implement a simple **array of lists** and perform insertion.

4. **Test Your Code**

   * Compile and run each program.
   * Make sure your program handles invalid input safely (e.g., division by zero, invalid index access).

5. **Submit Your Work**

   * Upload your completed `.cpp` files to **your personal GitHub repository** before the next lab.
   * Include proper comments and meaningful variable names.

## üìù **Deliverables**

* Pointer demonstration program (`pointers.cpp`)
* Function pointer calculator program (`function_pointers.cpp`)
* Dangling pointer example & fix (`dangling_pointer.cpp`)
* Dynamic memory allocation example (`dynamic_memory.cpp`)
* Array of list implementation (`array_of_list.cpp`)

---

## üìå **Important Notes**

* Write **clean, commented code** ‚Äî this is good practice and will help during debugging.
* Avoid memory leaks ‚Äî **always release memory** using `delete` or `free`.
* Do not copy-paste from the internet ‚Äî understand and write your own implementation.
