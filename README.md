## 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor**

**Course Instructor:** *Syed Shayan Ali Shah*
**Course Duration:** 16 September – 15 January
**Lecture Days:** **Thursday & Friday** (Weekly)
**Programming Language:** **C++**

---

## 📖 **Course Description**

This lab focuses on hands-on implementation of **core data structures** using **C++**.
Students will learn how data is organized, manipulated, and traversed in memory, using both **array-based** and **linked** representations.

---

## 🗂 **Lab Topics**

We will follow the textbook ***Fundamentals of Data Structures in C++ by Horowitz, Sahni, and Mehta*** and cover the following topics:

1. **Pointers Refresher**

   * Dereferencing
   * Dynamic Memory Allocation (`new`, `delete`)
   * Dangling Pointers & Memory Leaks

2. **List Data Structures**

   * List Operations
   * Array-based List Implementation

3. **Linked Lists**

   * Creating Nodes
   * Linking Nodes via Pointers
   * Insertion, Searching, Deletion
   * Singly, Doubly & Circular Lists

4. **Stacks**

   * Array-based Implementation
   * Linked List Implementation
   * Applications: Expression Conversion, Postfix Evaluation, Bracket Matching

5. **Queues**

   * Simple & Circular Queues
   * Linked List Implementation
   * Simulation Problems

6. **Recursion & Trees**

   * Binary Trees, BSTs
   * Traversals, Applications
   * AVL Trees (Insertion & Deletion)
   * Expression Trees, Huffman Coding

7. **Heaps, Hashing, and Graphs**

   * Heap Operations
   * Hash Functions, Collisions
   * Graph Representations
   * BFS and DFS Traversals

## 🏗 **How We Work**

* **Weekly Updates:**
  The repository will be updated **weekly before each lecture** with:

  * Lab problems
  * Starter code / skeletons
  * Practice exercises
  * Additional notes and resources

* **Student Workflow:**

  1. Pull or download the latest lab task from GitHub before class.
  2. Complete the task during the lab session.
  3. Submit your solution (if required) according to instructions given in class.

---

## 🛠 **Requirements**

* **Compiler:** g++ / any C++17 compliant compiler
* **IDE:** (Recommended) Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code
* **GitHub:** Students must know how to **clone**, **pull**, and **commit** code.

---

## 📌 **Important Notes**

* This repository is **continuously evolving** — check for updates every Wednesday evening.
* Focus on **writing clean, well-commented code**.
* Follow **best memory management practices** — avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers.

---



## 🎯 **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this lab, students will:

* Gain confidence in **implementing data structures from scratch**.
* Understand **memory management** and pointer manipulation in C++.
* Learn to solve **real-world problems** using data structures.
* Develop **clean, maintainable, and efficient C++ code**.
